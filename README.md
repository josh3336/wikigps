Too often we breeze through life in our own world not aware of what surrounds us, use wikiGPS as a virtual tour guide and learn interesting facts about the world around you.

WikiGPS is a web application that allows users to find Wikipedia entries near them.  It plots these entries on a map and lists them by proximity.   As a user moves the entries are dynamically updated based on their current position. 

WikiGps is built entirely in Javascript using Express, JQuery Mobile.  It connects and pulls content from the following APIs: Wikilocation, Mediawiki, Google maps and Ttsengine.
